1.What are the two types of Intents?
explicit intent and implicit intent


2.Which of the two types of Intents are more secure?
explicit is more secure, because you can't be certain what service will respond to the intent,
and the user can't see which service starts when using implicit intent


3.What type of Intent is shown on lines 69 to 73 of SecondFragment.kt?
implicit intent


4.What type of Intent is shown on lines 68 to 70 of ThirdFragment.kt?
explicit intent


5.Which of these two Intents is the proper way to do an Intent?
the explicit intent is a proper way

Fix the incorrect Intent:
modify secondfragment.kt file
use explicit intent like this:
var intent = Intent(activity, ProductScrollingActivity::class.java)
reason:to avoid using uncertain service which is malicious

2.2
add android:exported="false" in each activity in AndroidManifest.xml file
