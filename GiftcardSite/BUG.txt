why vulnerable:
I use postman to check input , I found that server only checks
that whether the Authorization is a valid token , but not check if the Authorization belongs to the
person who owns this card, so any one can use other's card by using his token with the right card id if
he just know other card's id(or just try many times on card's id)

how to fix:
in the server, check if the input Authorization match the card's owner's token,
only when matched ,do the use action
